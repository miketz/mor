;;; Commentary:
;;; `mor-mode-on-region' copies a highlighted region to a tmp buffer and
;;; turns on the mode of your choice.
;;; `mor-prev-mode-on-region' does the same thing, but recalls the previously
;;; chosen mode.
;;;
;;; Copy the text back with `mor-copy-back' or C-c b.
;;;                                            mnemonic: copy back
;;; Abandon your edits with `mor-close-tmp-buffer' or C-c c.
;;;                                                   mnemonic: close

;;; This package is useful to work with code in mutli-lanuage files.  Such as
;;; javascript, css, and html mixed in one file.
;;;
;;; It's also useful to interact with code in tech books; while viewing via
;;; eww-mode, text-mode, info-mode, etc.
;;; Some Emacs compatible books:
;;;   -- The `sicp' package on melpa is a great info-mode book.
;;;   -- The Practical Common Lisp in html form.  View with eww.
;;;   -- The Emacs Lisp intro, bundled with Emacs by default.  info-mode.
;;;
;;;
;;; NOTE: lexical binding is used as a potential micro-optimization for
;;; variable lookups.  This package *should* work whether lexical or dynamic
;;; binding is used.
;;; **This is no longer true.  Lexical binding is now used as way of providing
;;; private variables.  It is no longer just a micro-optimization.
